Description: Modified kernel modules for Intel RealSense cameras
 .
 The package has been tested and is compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 (64-bit) on
 x86 platforms running a 5.13 kernel.

 The package uses the DKMS system to automatically compile and install the
 modified driver on your current and future kernels.

 Please note that contrary to the original "librealsense2-dkms" package, the
 target needs to be rebooted for the change to take effect.
 .
 The present package also provides udev rules for Intel RealSense.
